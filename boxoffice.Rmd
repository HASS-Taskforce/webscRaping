# Read in webpage

We can look at https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekly/.

```{r}
url <- "https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekly/2025W13/"

html <- rvest::read_html(url)
```

# Is it stored as a table?

```{r}
week13 <- html |>
  rvest::html_table() |>
  _[[1]] |>
  dplyr::mutate(week = 13)
```

# Change urls to do it all as one

```{r}
get_table <- function(this_week) {
  rvest::read_html(paste0("https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekly/2025W", this_week, "/")) |>
  rvest::html_table() |>
  _[[1]]
}

week <- 1:13

weekly_data <- tibble(week) |>
  mutate(
    data = map(formatC(week, width = 2, format = "d", flag = "0"), get_table)
  ) |>
  unnest(data)
```

# Plot Gross

```{r}
weekly_data |>
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = Gross, color = Release, group = Release)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  theme(legend.position="none")
```

# Too many movies to see what's going on!

Let's try choosing only the ones that have ranked at the top for at least one week this year
```{r}
top_ranking <- weekly_data |>
  filter(Rank == 1) |>
  pull(Release) |>
  unique()

weekly_data |>
  filter(Release %in% top_ranking) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = Gross, color = Release, group = Release)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal()
```

What's happening with our y axis???

```{r}
clean_data <- weekly_data |>
  mutate(gross_format = as.numeric(str_remove_all(Gross, "[\\$,]")))

released_2024 <- weekly_data |>
  filter(Weeks == 1) |>
  pull(Release)

clean_data |>
  filter(Release %in% top_ranking & Release %in% released_2024) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = gross_format, color = Release, group = Release)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  theme_minimal()
```


Maybe we look at movies that had the biggest increases in gross relative to the previous week+

```{r}
clean_data <- clean_data |>
  rename(change_lw = "%Â± LW") |>
  mutate(change_lw = as.numeric(str_remove_all(change_lw, "[\\%,+]")))

weekly_increases <- clean_data |>
  arrange(desc(change_lw)) |>
  _[1:9,] |>
  pull(Release)

clean_data |>
  filter(Release %in% weekly_increases) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = gross_format, color = Release, group = Release)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  theme_minimal()
```
